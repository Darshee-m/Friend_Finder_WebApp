# ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬**Friend Finder App: Django Based WebApp to help you find friends similar to you**


## **Inspiration**
Making new friends as an adult isnâ€™t easy. It seems that everyone already has their friend group and theyâ€™re too busy to expand it. Simply meeting new people becomes increasingly rare. 
Luckily, making new friends doesnâ€™t have to entail removing the headphones of strangers just to see if theyâ€™re good friendship material or not. This webapp helps users seek people who are similar to them in terms of personality traits and similar likes and dislikes.


## **Features**
- Real Time Application
- Sound Recording in background
- Decibel Measurement.
- Storage on Cloud(MQTT) to save user device memory
- Processing on cloud(Firebase)

## **Demo**

## **Usage/ Architecture**

- The user starts the Sound Recording with a button.
- The noise is processed in the app and the db levels are measured, along with getting the location.
- Measured db levels are sent to be stored on the MQTT cloud
- The db levels are categorized and sorted in Firebase.
- If the noise levels are hazardous for human-beings or other fauna, the concerned authorities will be notified.
- Notifications will be sent in the form of emails through firebase.
